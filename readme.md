## What is it?

AR KPOP is an iOS app that uses augmented reality to bring kpop pictures to life. For now, there are certain images of kpop groups that if seen through the camera, will display one of their performances in augmented reality. Hopefully this project can be expanded to become even more fun and interesting in the future.

## Additional Info

This application is built on SwiftUI and ARSCNView for the AR components.
